Download pdf-parser.py from http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/

Extract pdf-parser.py into the same path as pdf-grapher.py.

Install pydot (https://code.google.com/p/pydot/)

Done!

== "Couldn't import dot_parser, loading of dot files will not be possible." ==
If you run pdf-grapher.py and receive the following error: "Couldn't import dot_parser, loading of dot files will not be possible."

According to this post http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15951748/pydot-and-graphviz-error-couldnt-import-dot-parser-loading-of-dot-files-will it's due to the changes between pyparsing 1.x and 2.x

This fix worked for me:

  pip uninstall pyparsing

  pip install -Iv https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyparsing/pyparsing-1.5.7.tar.gz#md5=9be0fcdcc595199c646ab317c1d9a709

  pip install pydot
